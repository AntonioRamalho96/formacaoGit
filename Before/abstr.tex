\begin{abstract}
    In this work it is presented an online trajectory-planner for multi-rotors. The planner is capable of generating trajectories in partially unknown environments with moving obstacles. The developed algorithms are capable of quickly avoid unexpected obstacles, both static and moving. The trajectory planner is based on a modified RRT and  a trajectory-optimization algorithm. The cost function used is a combination of trajectory time and energy/fuel consumption in order to allow the generation of optimal trajectories in terms of mission costs. Several simulations are performed and the real-time avoidance capability of the proposed solution is validated. Physics simulations are also performed using Gazebo to show the possibility of using these algorithms for agressive multi-rotor maneuvering.
