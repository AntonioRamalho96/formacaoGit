abstract="A new real-time trajectory generation scheme for differentially flat systems with constraints is proposed. Differential flatness is exploited for both the construction of trajectories as well as for making sure the constructed trajectories satisfy the constraints of the system. The main feature of the approach is that rather good tracking for varying desired behaviour is possible. The reference trajectory is constructed by concatenating trajectory pieces the endpoints of which not necessarily correspond to equilibria. Special care has to be taken to make sure that such trajectory pieces can be continued without violating constraints.",
